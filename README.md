# TODO

## Create auto-sort script
- ~~Sort by file type~~
- ~~Make sub-directories for each file type~~
- ~~Have it work for Windows/Mac/Linux OS~~

## Customizations
- ~~Sort/Assign by name, date~~
- ~~Filter out specific files into a different sub-dir (ex: Images, Documents, Coding, etc.)~~
- ~~Change where it stores these files (folder type)~~
- ~~Be able to change what it names each folder~~
- ~~Add a tagging system (ex: foo-TAG.png)~~

## Visualization
- ~~Add GUI (PyQT)~~
- ~~Add Folder drag & drop feature~~
- ~~Add buttons & filter options within menu~~
- ~~Clean up GUI, add icon / other metadata~~
- Add advanced settings (path changing, types, categories)

## Finishing touches
- Update README
